This plugin supports Textile syntax for posts.

== Description ==

This plugin supports *Textile* syntax for posts. It's just a thin wrapper of *Textile 2.0.0*.

1. The Textile syntax works only in between '{{{'  and '}}}.' A single post can have one or more Textiler blocks. But usually a full post might be in a block.
1. To see all supported Textile syntax, go [Textiler plugin test page](http://ideathinking.com/blog-v2/?p=44) or [Textile
page](http://textile.thresholdstate.com/).
